Overview
===============
dep-analyzer is a Clang-based tool for dumping dependency info from a C/C++ module.

Requirements
===============

This has currently only been tested against clang 3.9.
Clang APIs tend to change between versions, so this is unlikely to work
on earlier versions of clang.

Building
=========

Run 'cmake .', followed by 'make', in this directory.

Running
=========

In the target source directory, run:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON .
$ /path/to/dep-analyzer -class=.*ClassName -p . path/to/foo.cc \
    -extra-arg=-isystem -extra-arg=/path/to/clang/3.9.0/include

(it's not clear why the clang include directory has to be explicitly included,
but it probably does)
